= Signing

Conforma relies on https://www.sigstore.dev/[Sigstore] signatures to verify the
authenticity of content being verified. Currently, this is integrated with the `ec validate image`
command.

== Image Verification

When Conforma validates an image, there are certain
https://conforma.dev/docs/ec-policies/release_policy.html#builtin_attestation_package[builtin]
policy rules that are always applied and cannot be skipped. Most of these rely on
https://github.com/sigstore/cosign[cosign] to fetch and verify image signatures and attestations.
These meta artifacts are associated to the underlying container image by digest. This has two
important properties. First, the image and its meta artifacts can be copied to another repository or
registry without affecting validation. Second, the meta artifact for one image cannot be used to
fulfill the validation of another image.

== Sigstore Levels

There are different levels of Sigstore adoption. These can be done
https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/adopting-sigstore-incrementally[incrementally].
Conforma can be used to validate artifacts regardless of the level.

=== Long-Lived Keys

Using long-lived keys is the easiest and simplest way to adopt Sigstore. For verification, there are
two requirements. The public key itself and a flag to indicate that Rekor integration should be
disabled:

[,bash]
----
ec validate image --public-key=cosign.pub --ignore-rekor --image $IMAGE
----

=== Long-Lived Keys with Auditability

This approach uses https://docs.sigstore.dev/rekor/overview/[Rekor] to track when the signing key is
used. When using the public instance of Rekor, the only requirement is the public key:

[,bash]
----
ec validate image --public-key=cosign.pub --image $IMAGE
----

Using an <<Alternative Rekor>> instance is also supported.

=== Identity-Based Short-Lived Keys ("keyless")

This is the strongest and most sophisticated Sigstore level. Here a complete Sigstore deployment is
required. Verification is no longer based on a key. Instead, it is based on the signer's identity.
There are two pieces of information required, the certificate identity and the certificate OIDC
issuer:

[,bash]
----
ec validate image --certificate-identity=$IDENTITY --certificate-oidc-issuer=$ISSUER --image $IMAGE
----

NOTE: `--certificate-identity` and `--certificate-oidc-issue` flags perform an exact value match.
Use `--certificate-identity-regexp` and `--certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp` to perform a regular
expression match if additional flexibility is needed.

Any certificate involved in the signature is also provided as xref:policy_input.adoc[policy input].
Use this data to establish a fine-grained verification process by leveraging rego policies. See the
xref:ec-policies:ROOT:release_policy.adoc#github_certificate_package[GitHub Certificate Checks] as
an example.

As with the previous level, it is also possible to use an <<Alternative Rekor>> instance during
verification.

== Alternative Rekor

By default, the `ec validate image` command uses the production https://rekor.sigstore.dev/[public
instance] of Rekor. This section describes different ways to use an alternative Rekor instance
during validation.

The simplest, and preferred method, is to use `cosign initialize` to populate the Sigstore root from
an alternative TUF mirror:

[,bash]
----
cosign initialize -mirror $TUF_MIRROR -root $TUF_ROOT
ec validate image ...
----

NOTE: See `cosign initialize --help` for details on initializing the Sigstore root.

If the Sigstore deployment does not include a TUF mirror, first delete the Sigstore root, then use
the `--rekor-url` flag:

[,bash]
----
rm -rf ~/.sigstore/root
ec validate image --rekor-url $REKOR_URL ...
----
